# M-to-m

This program takes an input text file, and changes the lower case m's to upper case M's, and vice versa.
Additionally, there is another program that generates text files of abitrary size and length by asking for chunks of megabytes.
For instance, a 2 gigabyte text file would be 2048 megabyte chunks. As of now, the program will not be able to handle such a large 
text file, but the plan is to get the M Converter to read files and process files in managable sized chunks and also write in chunks.
