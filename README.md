This github repository contains two programs. The first is a program, called FileMakeLine, that generates a text file of random letters and organizes them to have english grammar structure. The second program, Called MConvertStream, takes input text files and prints out the same text file with the lower case m's as upper case m's and vice versa. 

To use MConvertStream in maven, clone the repository, enter it, and run mvn exec:java -Dinput="path/to/file"
