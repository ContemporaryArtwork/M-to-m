This program takes an input text file, and changes the lower case m's to upper case M's, and vice versa.
Additionally, there is another program that generates text files of abitrary size and length by asking for chunks of megabytes.
For instance, a 2 gigabyte text file would be 2048 megabyte chunks. The program takes such text files and reads them in chunks as to not read the whole file into memory and waste system resources.
